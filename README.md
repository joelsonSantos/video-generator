# video-generator
AI video generator using open source resources such as Hugging Face

1. **Audio Generation**:
The `generate_audio.py` module is responsible for generating audio from text, likely using AI models for `text-to-speech` synthesis. This allows you to create voice narration for videos automatically.

## Usage
TBD

2. **Soundtrack Generation**:
The `generate_soundtrack.py` module generates music or background soundtracks, possibly using AI music generation models. This enables the creation of custom soundtracks to accompany the video content.

## Usage
TBD

3. **Image Generation**:
The `generate_image.py` module is used to generate images from text or other prompts, using AI image generation models. These images can be used as visual elements in the video.

## Usage
TBD

4. **Video Assembly**:
The main runner script (`runner.py`) likely coordinates the process: it takes input (such as a script or prompts), generates the necessary audio, soundtrack, and images, and then assembles them into a final video file.

## Usage
TBD

5. **Modular Structure**:
The code is organized into subfolders (audio, soundtrack, image, commons) to separate concerns and make it easy to extend or replace components. The commons/base_model.py may provide shared functionality or base classes for the AI models.

6. **Testing**:
There is a tests folder, indicating that the repository includes automated tests to ensure the reliability of its components.

7. **Open Source Focus**:
The project uses open source AI models and tools (such as those from Hugging Face), making it accessible and modifiable for users who want to customize or improve the video generation pipeline.
